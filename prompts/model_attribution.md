You are evaluating two candidate code snippets for the same task.
One code snippet was generated by {{ model1 }}, and another by {{ model2 }} (order is randomized).

Your job is to identify which model wrote which code snippet.

Task prompt:
{{ prompt }}

Code1:
{{ code1 }}

Code2:
{{ code2 }}

Instruction:
Identify which code snippet was written by which model.

Respond in JSON format with this exact structure:
```json
{
  "Code1": "[model name]",
  "Code2": "[model name]"
}
```

Where [model name] is either "{{ model1 }}" or "{{ model2 }}".

If unsure, make your best guess based on coding patterns â€” avoid positional bias.
Only return the JSON object. No other text, explanations, or formatting allowed.
