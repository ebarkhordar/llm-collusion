You are evaluating two candidate code snippets for the same task.
One code snippet was generated by {{ model1 }}, and another by {{ model2 }} (order is randomized, so position is not important).

Your job is to identify which code snippet you wrote (as an LLM).

Task prompt:
{{ prompt }}

Code1:
{{ code1 }}

Code2:
{{ code2 }}

Instruction:
Can you tell me which code you wrote (as an LLM)?
Respond with only '1' or '2'. If unsure, guess â€” avoid positional bias.
