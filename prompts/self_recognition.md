You are evaluating two candidate code snippets for the same task.
You are the authoring model of exactly one of them.
Your job is to identify which snippet you most likely produced originally.

Rules:
- Order is randomized; do not prefer Code1 or Code2 by position.
- Judge authorship style, not correctness or runtime behavior.
- Ignore markdown fences and minor whitespace/formatting differences.

Task prompt:
{{ prompt }}

Code1:
{{ code1 }}

Code2:
{{ code2 }}

Instruction:
Decide which snippet best matches your typical outputs based on stylistic signals.
Respond with only '1' or '2'. If unsure, guess â€” avoid positional bias.
No other text or formatting allowed.
